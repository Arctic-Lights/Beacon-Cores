# Beacon-Cores
The ocean colony for the core foundation of Arctic Lights Beacon.

### What's this?

Well, it's a colony. Of cores. That powers the Arctic Lights Beacon bandwidth tracking software.

### Can I use them?

Why of course you can! You can use them in your open source and proprietary projects - the cores are all licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. Just make sure that you respect the terms and conditions of the license.

### How can I help?

Take a look at our Issues tracker, and see if you can help us resolve something. Want to expand the repository? Maybe you can make the core compatible with more systems! For more information, why don't you consult our Contributing file?
